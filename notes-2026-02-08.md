❯ Can you look at both the Breakroom web application and also either the Android or iPhone application (both of
  which are on this machine in folders next to the web app folder) and tell me what, if anything needs to change
  about the Breakroom web app.  Note, currently the iPhone and Android apps are very similar in look and feel and
  the web app is quite different. I am wonder if certain mobile app features should be brought into the web

● I'll explore both the web and mobile codebases in parallel to do a thorough comparison.

  Feature Completeness: Web vs. Mobile

  The One Major Gap: Profile Page

  This is the biggest functional difference. The mobile apps have a rich, detailed profile while the web only has the
  basics.

  What the web Profile has:
  - Photo upload/delete
  - First name, last name, bio (with character counter)
  - Handle, email, member-since display

  What the mobile apps have that the web is missing:
  - Skills section — searchable skill tags with autocomplete suggestions, add/remove capability, displayed as colored
  capsule badges
  - Work Experience section — full CRUD for job history (title, company, location, date range with "current job" toggle,
   description), sorted with current jobs first
  - Work Biography — separate from the regular bio, with its own 1,000-character limit and counter
  - Location fields — city/state/country on the user profile
  - Friend count display on the profile

  Look & Feel Differences Worth Addressing

  You mentioned the mobile apps look similar to each other but the web feels different. Here are the UX/design patterns
  the mobile apps share that the web doesn't:

  1. Navigation Structure

  - Mobile: 5-tab bottom navigation (Breakroom, Chat, Jobs, Company, Tool Shed) + hamburger drawer for secondary items
  (Profile, Friends, Blog, Shortcuts, Logout)
  - Web: Top header nav bar with text links

  This is expected — bottom tabs are a mobile pattern. But the web could benefit from a persistent sidebar navigation on
   desktop that mirrors the mobile organization, rather than a flat header bar. This would make the two feel more
  unified.

  2. Status Badges & Color Coding

  - Mobile: Extensive use of colored badges everywhere — priority (gray/blue/orange/red), status
  (green/orange/blue/purple/gray), publish state (green dot vs gray dot), role badges (Owner in orange, Admin in blue),
  employment type, location type
  - Web: Has badges but they're less consistently styled across screens

  A unified badge/chip component on the web with the same color vocabulary as mobile would bring visual consistency.

  3. Empty States

  - Mobile: Every list/tab has a dedicated empty state with helpful messaging ("No Pending Requests", "Everyone is your
  friend!", "No songs yet — create one!")
  - Web: Some screens have empty states, but coverage is inconsistent

  4. Card Design Consistency

  - Mobile: Consistent card style across all screens — rounded corners (12px), subtle elevation/shadow, consistent
  padding and spacing
  - Web: Card styles vary between screens since each view uses scoped CSS independently

  5. Connection Status Indicator

  - Mobile: Clean green/red dot in the chat header showing Socket.IO connection state
  - Web: Has connection status in chat, but the mobile approach of a simple colored dot is cleaner and more universal

  6. Loading & Progress States

  - Mobile: Consistent circular progress indicators and disabled-button states during async operations across every
  screen
  - Web: Has loading states but they vary in style between screens

  Recommendations (Prioritized)

  High Priority

  1. Bring the Profile page to parity — Add skills (with autocomplete search), work experience (CRUD with date pickers),
   work biography field, location fields, and friend count. This is the only real feature gap and it's significant since
   the profile is central to a social platform.

  Medium Priority

  2. Standardize badges/chips — Create a shared component for status badges, priority badges, role badges, and type
  badges with the same color vocabulary the mobile apps use. Apply it consistently across all screens.
  3. Standardize card components — Create a shared card wrapper with consistent border-radius, shadows, and padding so
  all screens feel cohesive.
  4. Add empty states everywhere — Audit every list/tab and add friendly empty-state messaging where missing.

  Lower Priority (Polish)

  5. Standardize loading states — Use a consistent spinner/skeleton pattern across all screens.
  6. Consider a sidebar nav on desktop — A persistent left sidebar with icons (like the mobile bottom tab bar) could
  make the web feel more app-like and aligned with the mobile experience, while keeping the top bar for
  user/profile/notifications.

  Bottom Line

  Functionally, the web and mobile apps are almost at parity — the Profile page is the only screen with a significant
  feature gap (missing skills, work experience, work bio). The rest of the differences are about visual consistency and
  polish rather than missing features. A shared design language (badges, cards, empty states, loading patterns) would go
   a long way toward making the web feel like it belongs to the same product family as the mobile apps.
