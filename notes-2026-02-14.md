My interpretation of robot derived differences between iOS mobile app and website:

1) Sidebar nav on desktop

On the desktop there are a number of navigation options which are on the top compared to the mobile app which has them on the side.  This is something we should consider changing. Note, we should do some research first to see what is typical of other sites.  Also note, the website may actually need to handle both cases since it could either be in a wide browser or a narrow one (or even on a phone but in the browser).  I think typically it should look exactly like the mobile site if the browser window is narrow enough, however it is questionable whether that navigation should continue into wider situations.

2) The prosaurus professional dinosoaur logo should feature somewhere on the website other than just in the favicon.  I am thinking in the home page (when not logged in) and perhaps on the login page also...  Side note, currently the iPhone app shows the logo and underneath it says "Breakroom".  This is confusing because the logo itself has the word "Prosaurus" in it.  I think the word Breakroom should simply be removed

3) The about page on the website should remove references to Breakroom and replace them with Prosaurus. (including teh Get Stared with Breakroom button)

4) On the website, the dropdown menu under username is too wide, it should only be as wide as it needs to be to have the menu items (Profile and Logout currently)...  Note, this may be irrelevent of the entire design is redone per the first issue in this document.

5) Currently the website features a purple to green color transition on the "Breakroom" text on the main page and also features some color transition in the Tool Shed and other shortcut links (which may go away).  The iPhone app has no such similar coloring.  I am divided on whether or not like the web version or the iPhone version but I am certain that they should match in some way.

6) The robot noticed an inconsistency in the profile page where jobs had only a text field for city/state/country where the profile has those separated.  The robot also said that the Weather Widget had the city geocoding.  The only real problem i see here is that there is no way for the user to specify what city/state/country exactly they live in (which is probably the data that the weather widget depends on).  User interface elements for modifying this should be added to the profile page.  As for the inconsistency between profile specific location data and job specific data, I don't think it is necessary to locate jobs that specifically so leave that part alone.

7) We need a good solution for the widget placement during varying screen widths.  Currently there are 1 to 5 widget spaces available depending on the width.  What I would like is for each size to be configurable independently.  The system should start off with some sensible defaults but then it should allow the user to reorganize/resize the widgets as they please to fit each individual width and it should save that on the backend.  Whenever the browser is resized between one column width count and another it should read from the backend what the configuration was for that column count and reorganize as needed.
