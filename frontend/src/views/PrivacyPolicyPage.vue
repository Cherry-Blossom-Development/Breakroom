          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We work with trusted third-party vendors who assist us in

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
        you with services. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within
        a reasonable period, except where we are required to retain it for legal or legitimate business
        purposes (such as resolving disputes or complying with legal obligations).
      </p>
      <p>
        Content you have shared that other users have interacted with (such as comments on a post) may
        remain in a modified form after account deletion to preserve the integrity of those interactions.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from
        unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. These measures include encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS),
        secure password hashing, and access controls on our servers. However, no method of transmission
        over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. Do not share your login credentials
        with anyone.
